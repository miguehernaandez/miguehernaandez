# Miguel Hernandez

## Full Stack Developer

Hello! My name is Miguel and I'm Web Developer.

I am a young passionate about technology, eager to take on great challenges that make me learn and grow, willing to solve any problem presented making use of the technical skills that I have developed so far, as well as highlighting my non-technical skills, being a very adaptable, empathetic, supportive person who likes to work in a team.

I have experience developing in JavaScript as FullStack using technologies like: React.js, Redux, Angular, Nest.js, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

## Principle proyects

### Frontend

* [Climapp](https://github.com/miguehernaandez/Climapp): It's a little app who consume an external API. You can search any city and the app gonna show you the params of temperature of this city. This page was development using React and I start to doing it after using this same API in a class.

* [ASTRA](https://github.com/miguehernaandez/ASTRA-Ecommerce): It is an application developed using React-Redux and React-Bootstrap in the front-end and NodeJS, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL in the backend. This app was developing by an instance of SoyHenry bootcamp.

* [Henryapp](https://github.com/miguehernaandez/Henryapp): It is an application developed using React, MaterialUI, Apollo Client and Graphql in the frontend and MongoDB, Mongoose and Apollo Server in the back end. This app was developing by an instance of SoyHenry bootcamp, it is intended to be used in the future by SoyHenry.

I'm currently studying Full Stack Web Development in a online bootcamp call it "SoyHenry", where I study the following technologies: 

* Git: We learn the basic commands and we used github like principle plataform in this bootcamp. For that, we learn about the practical and conceptual way to use git.

* Advanced javascript: We start with data structures and algorithms, next Hoisting and Closure and finish with Promises, ES6, Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, etc.

* React: We start learning basic concepts of this library, development little proyects with the learning. And we learning about Hooks, states, lifecycles of components, roots, etc.  

* Redux: We learn how to use this library in React Projects, to keeping global states y development more scalable aplications.

* Webpack + Babel: We learn to configure and prepair a project where we can use all the functionalitty of ES6 and JSX in the browser. Also, we configured a testing enviroment to see the changes in real time, giving us time optimization of processes.

* Express: We learn how to create our own APIs and web servers to be consumed by the frontend app or the web browser. I learn how creates multiples routes with multiple contents each one. We use middlewares to increase the functionalities of our programs and we perform interesting proyects to practice everything we learned. 

* Unit testing: Utilización de los principales frameworks y Test Runners para el correcto testeo de cada elemento de una alicación, así como la metodología de Desarrollo guiado por pruebas o TDD. Using the principle frameworks and Test Runners to correctly testing of each element of an app, as well as the metodology of developvent throw Test-driven development (TDD).

 * PostgreSQL/Sequalize: Implementation and design of relational database with Postgres. Sequalize make more dynamic the implementation of the relational database, creation of models that can be extended by any person, database interaction in a practical and easy way.

* I will keep updating this section with all the new things I learn.
