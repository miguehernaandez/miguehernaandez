# Hello! Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile.

## Full Stack Developer

I am a young passionate about technology, eager to take on great challenges that make me learn and grow, willing to solve any problem presented making use of the technical skills that I have developed so far, as well as highlighting my non-technical skills, being a very adaptable, empathetic, supportive person who likes to work in a team.

I have experience developing in JavaScript and TypeScript as FullStack using technologies like: React.js, Vue.js, Angular, Redux, Nest.js, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
